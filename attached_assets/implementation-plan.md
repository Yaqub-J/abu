# AWS Amplify Backend Implementation Plan for ABU Alumni Platform

## 1. Project Setup & Authentication

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Initialize Amplify in your existing frontend project
amplify init

# Add authentication
amplify add auth

# Configure auth with the settings we defined earlier
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Manual configuration
? Select the authentication/authorization services that you want to use: User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls
? Provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: abuAlumniAuth
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Email, Username
? Do you want to configure advanced settings? Yes
...
# Configure user groups for Alumni, Admins, etc.
```

### Auth Functions
Create Lambda triggers for:
- Pre-signup validation
- Post-confirmation (to create initial user profile)
- Custom message handling for branded emails

## 2. GraphQL API Setup

```bash
# Add API
amplify add api

# Choose GraphQL, with Amazon Cognito user pool for authorization type
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: GraphQL
? Provide API name: abuAlumniAPI
? Choose the default authorization type for the API: Amazon Cognito User Pool
? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API: Yes
? Configure additional auth types? Yes
? Choose the additional authorization types you want to configure for the API: IAM, API key
```

Import the GraphQL schema we defined earlier.

## 3. Storage Configuration

```bash
# Add storage for user files (profile pictures, event images, etc.)
amplify add storage

# Configure S3 with appropriate access patterns
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: Content
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: abuAlumniStorage
? Please provide bucket name: abu-alumni-storage
? Who should have access: Auth users only
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? create/update, read, delete
```

## 4. Functions Implementation

Create Lambda functions for:

### Alumni Search Function
```bash
amplify add function

? Provide a friendly name for your resource: searchAlumniFunction
? Provide the AWS Lambda function name: searchAlumniFunction
? Choose the runtime that you want to use: NodeJS
? Choose the function template that you want to use: Hello World
```

Implementation will include:
- ElasticSearch integration for advanced alumni search
- Filtering by graduation year, department, location, etc.

### Dashboard Statistics Function
```bash
amplify add function

? Provide a friendly name for your resource: getDashboardStatsFunction
? Provide the AWS Lambda function name: getDashboardStatsFunction
? Choose the runtime that you want to use: NodeJS
? Choose the function template that you want to use: Hello World
```

Implementation will aggregate data across:
- User counts and activity
- Donation metrics
- Event participation
- Group engagement

### Payment Processing Functions
```bash
amplify add function

? Provide a friendly name for your resource: getPaymentIntentFunction
? Provide the AWS Lambda function name: getPaymentIntentFunction
? Choose the runtime that you want to use: NodeJS
? Choose the function template that you want to use: Hello World
```

Implementation will:
- Integrate with PayStack, Stripe, or PayPal
- Handle payment intents securely
- Process international payments
- Create donation records

### Notification Function
```bash
amplify add function

? Provide a friendly name for your resource: sendBulkNotificationsFunction 
? Provide the AWS Lambda function name: sendBulkNotificationsFunction
? Choose the runtime that you want to use: NodeJS
? Choose the function template that you want to use: Hello World
```

Implementation will handle:
- Push notifications via Amazon SNS
- Email notifications via Amazon SES
- In-app notifications saved to database

## 5. Hosting Configuration

```bash
# Add hosting for your web frontend
amplify add hosting

# Configure CloudFront distribution for global access
? Select the plugin module to execute: Hosting with Amplify Console
? Choose a type: Manual deployment
```

## 6. CI/CD Setup

Configure Amplify Console CI/CD pipeline:
- Connect to your GitHub repository
- Set up environment variables
- Configure build settings for web and backend
- Set up branch-based deployments (dev, staging, production)

## 7. Security & Compliance Implementation

### Data Protection
- Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Set up AWS WAF for API protection
- Configure VPC for database isolation

### Compliance
- Set up CloudWatch Logs for audit trails
- Implement PCI-DSS compliant patterns for payment handling
- Configure GDPR-compliant data retention policies

## 8. Testing Plan

### API Testing
- Create collections in Postman for all API endpoints
- Write automated tests using Jest for Lambda functions
- Set up integration tests for complete user flows

### Security Testing
- Perform penetration testing on APIs
- Conduct IAM policy reviews
- Test authentication flows for vulnerabilities

## 9. Deployment Strategy

### Phased Rollout
1. Deploy Authentication & Core User Management
2. Deploy Profile & Networking Features
3. Deploy Events & Content Management
4. Deploy Donation System
5. Deploy Community Features (Groups & Projects)

### For Each Phase:
- Create feature branch
- Implement and test locally
- Deploy to dev environment
- Conduct QA testing
- Deploy to staging for stakeholder review
- Deploy to production

## 10. Post-Launch Monitoring

### Observability Setup
- Configure CloudWatch dashboards for key metrics
- Set up alarms for performance and error thresholds
- Implement X-Ray for tracing API calls and Lambda executions

### Analytics Integration
- Set up Amplify Analytics category
- Implement event tracking for key user actions
- Create dashboards for user engagement metrics

## 11. Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Data Protection
- Configure automated backups for DynamoDB tables
- Set up cross-region replication for S3 buckets
- Create restoration procedures documentation

### Failover Strategy
- Design multi-region deployment for high availability
- Document disaster recovery procedures
- Schedule regular restoration drills
